# Open Trade Transfer Package
A structure that allows files to be generated to facilitate the exchange of data concerning trade. It can be utilized to exchange information on product specifications, requirements, defaults and restrictions as well as capabilities. It can also be used to exchange a material list or other needed related data.

Is meant to facilitate both XML and JSON creation.

## How to define the file as an Open Trade Transfer Package
Within the root level, you need to specify an element with the name of "open_trade_transfer_package":

#### Examples
```
{
  "open_trade_transfer_package": {
    "version": "0.1"
}
```

```
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>
<open_trade_transfer_package version="0.01">
</open_trade_transfer_package>
```

## Version
Current version is 0.1. This should stated in every file as shoed in the example above. 0.1 is the first released version, and there is no prior versions.

## Structure
Within the root level (open_trade_transfer_package) everything is divided into four groups and their subgroups:

- information
- products
  - product (can be many)
- profiles
  - defaults
  - enforced
  - restricted
- capability
  - summary
  - materials
- custom
  - colors
  - materials

## Data formats
When possible subelements are documented, they need to specify what format to use. Possible formats are:

- Percentage - Denotes a percentage - all percentages are expressed as percent out of 100- for example 10.4% is written as "10.4" and not "0.104"
- List - The data has only a fixed number of values that are selected from the list in the description table for the tag.  These items are case sensitive, and no other values are allowed.
- Text - The data is free format text.  For multiline entries, line breaks will be preserved where possible and the text may be truncated on import if the text is too long for the importing program to store.  Multiline entries may be split with either a newline (Unix format) or a carriage return â€“ newline combination (DOS format).  Importing programs should accept either.
- Boolean - May be either TRUE or FALSE, with TRUE and FALSE in capitals.  A default value should be specified for optional fields - the default is used if the value is not present.
- Integer - An integer number with no decimal point.  May include negative values - examples include ...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,...
- Floating Point - A floating point number, usually expressed in its simplest form with a decimal point as in "1.2", "0.004", etc...  Programs shall endeavor to store as many significant digits as possible to avoid truncating or losing small values.

## Possible elements in the "information" group

### project

### version
